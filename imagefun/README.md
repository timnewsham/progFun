# imageFun

This is fun with image generation in JS. It has a simple engine that calls
the `color` function to compute each pixel color. It also has a `text` function
for generating status text on the image.  The idea is to build fun images with
math functions.  Time units are in seconds. X and Y coordinates are over the range
from zero to one.
